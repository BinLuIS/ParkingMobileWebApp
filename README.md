## Business Logic of Parking System
Assumption:
We have partnered with some parking service provider which will have their own parking boys helping customers park their cars.

Our parking system is a platform showing which parking lot a customer is going to park his/her car to so that parking boys can take the order and make money. On top of that, this parking system provides a management tool, covering utilization rate of each parking lot, resource planning (who are on duty).

Our parking system earns money by subscription for each parking service provider and advertisement.
