## Business Logic of Parking System
This web app is a inhouse tool of a multinational parking service provider.

Customers use our application to ask for car parking service in this web app, our internal parking clerks use this app to compete for car parking service to make extra money. On top of that, we have a management console for human resource management, parking lot management (i.e. which parking lot that a parking clerk will manage), car service request assignment (assign car service to some parking clerk)
